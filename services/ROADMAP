** v0.1.0
*** v0.0.1
**** Found a way to generate documentation
     
     For registered function and objects, we must have HTML
     documentation for C++/guile/ruby.

     See doxygen for aliasses and custom output. In last ressort, use
     the given XML output and generator to generate our own HTML output.

- [ ] Try in apidoc/
  Using doxygen to include ../logger/src
  With logger classes usable in extension in particular group
  explain this in APIDOC.org


**** Make logger usable in plugins using SWIG

**** Must have a common interface
     
     To register C++ functions and objects to guile and ruby.
     C++ code may be in shared library. Maybe using the PubSub
     design pattern.

- [ ] Make a list if possible events name
  events name become function names in guile/ruby

**** TODO Correct project setup
- [ ] Uses autotools
- [ ] all sources go in src/
- [ ] generate a pkg-config file
- [ ] create a DEPENDENCIES
- [ ] Create a wiki page under NewrojectLayout
