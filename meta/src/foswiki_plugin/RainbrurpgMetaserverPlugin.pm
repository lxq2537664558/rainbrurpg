# $RELEASE is used in the "Find More Extensions" automation in configure.
# It is a manually maintained string used to identify functionality steps.
# You can use any of the following formats:
# tuple   - a sequence of integers separated by . e.g. 1.2.3. The numbers
#           usually refer to major.minor.patch release or similar. You can
#           use as many numbers as you like e.g. '1' or '1.2.3.4.5'.
# isodate - a date in ISO8601 format e.g. 2009-08-07
# date    - a date in 1 Jun 2009 format. Three letter English month names only.
# Note: it's important that this string is exactly the same in the extension
# topic - if you use %$RELEASE% with BuildContrib this is done automatically.

=begin TML

---++ finishPlugin()

Called when Foswiki is shutting down, this handler can be used by the plugin
to release resources - for example, shut down open database connections,
release allocated memory etc.

Note that it's important to break any cycles in memory allocated by plugins,
or that memory will be lost when Foswiki is run in a persistent context
e.g. mod_perl.

=cut

#sub finishPlugin {
#}

=begin TML

---++ preRenderingHandler( $text, \%map )
   * =$text= - text, with the head, verbatim and pre blocks replaced
     with placeholders
   * =\%removed= - reference to a hash that maps the placeholders to
     the removed blocks.

Handler called immediately before Foswiki syntax structures (such as lists) are
processed, but after all variables have been expanded. Use this handler to
process special syntax only recognised by your plugin.

Placeholders are text strings constructed using the tag name and a
sequence number e.g. 'pre1', "verbatim6", "head1" etc. Placeholders are
inserted into the text inside &lt;!--!marker!--&gt; characters so the
text will contain &lt;!--!pre1!--&gt; for placeholder pre1.

Each removed block is represented by the block text and the parameters
passed to the tag (usually empty) e.g. for
<verbatim>
<pre class='slobadob'>
XYZ
</pre>
</verbatim>
the map will contain:
<pre>
$removed->{'pre1'}{text}:   XYZ
$removed->{'pre1'}{params}: class="slobadob"
</pre>
Iterating over blocks for a single tag is easy. For example, to prepend a
line number to every line of every pre block you might use this code:
<verbatim>
foreach my $placeholder ( keys %$map ) {
    if( $placeholder =~ /^pre/i ) {
        my $n = 1;
        $map->{$placeholder}{text} =~ s/^/$n++/gem;
    }
}
</verbatim>

__NOTE__: This handler is called once for each rendered block of text i.e.
it may be called several times during the rendering of a topic.

*NOTE:* meta-data is _not_ embedded in the text passed to this
handler.

*NOTE:* Read the developer supplement at
Foswiki:Development.AddToZoneFromPluginHandlers if you are calling
=addToZone()= from this handler

Since Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION = '2.0'

=cut

#sub preRenderingHandler {
#    my( $text, $pMap ) = @_;
#
#    # You can work on $text in place by using the special perl
#    # variable $_[0]. These allow you to operate on $text
#    # as if it was passed by reference; for example:
#    # $_[0] =~ s/SpecialString/my alternative/ge;
#}

=begin TML


=begin TML

---++ restExample($session) -> $text

This is an example of a sub to be called by the =rest= script. The parameter is:
   * =$session= - The Foswiki object associated to this session.

Additional parameters can be recovered via the query object in the $session, for example:

my $query = $session->{request};
my $web = $query->{param}->{web}[0];

If your rest handler adds or replaces equivalent functionality to a standard script
provided with Foswiki, it should set the appropriate context in its switchboard entry.
A list of contexts are defined in %SYSTEMWEB%.IfStatements#Context_identifiers.

For more information, check %SYSTEMWEB%.CommandAndCGIScripts#rest

For information about handling error returns from REST handlers, see
Foswiki:Support.Faq1

*Since:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION 2.0
