- [ ] Create a configure option to switch between oldOgreGui and new one
- [ ] OgreGui2 is a separate project that intends to completely replace OgreGui.
      It is a new design that should be more bug-free. This project must be 
      merged with the current rainbrurpg sources.

**** TODO Coding standards
- [ ] All code should be in a src/ directory. Using of `sloccount` is easier.
- [ ] Should split the common/ library in commnon/ and net/
- [ ] May headers files be called *.hpp
- [ ] Add GNU headers to MAkefile.am files
- [ ] Doxyfile should take version from configure
      By creating a Doxyfile.in file
- [ ] Should remove all unused source files from topdir
      There are autogenerated files from autoproject
**** Make a better use of CppUnit (see libkics for example)
- [ ] autoregister test fixtures
- [ ] no templates
- [ ] Integrate it to make check
