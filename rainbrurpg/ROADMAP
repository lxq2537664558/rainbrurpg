*** BuddyFinder in gsServerList
*** v0.1.4
**** Editor prints a datafiles dependencies
- Editor pass through FTP (like LS)
- Server uses a SQL query

*** v0.1.3
**** Server executes scripts
- Example
  - client send a packet telling ObjectName.click()
  - Server execute the script (example PErso.message())
  - Server send a packet from the LUA code
**** Server identifiation and GPG keys
**** Server backup system
- The same list as datafiles synchronisation create a tr.bz2 archive
- restore backup
*** v0.1.2
**** Editor may move objects
- [ ] NetPacket send by editor to the server
- [ ] Server send new position of object
**** Screenshots
- .RainbruRPG/Screenshots/ directory
- A txt fileis create containing
name, date, heure, gamestate, position, name perso, name server, versions
- need GameState::getFullName()
- Singleton ScreenShotManager takes them (F11 key)

*** Server become a console only application
      We also need a server-ctl binary to be able to use the server as a
      GNU/Linux daemon. --stop should have a 5mn delay if connexion are present.
      We could also use` start-stop-daemon`.
