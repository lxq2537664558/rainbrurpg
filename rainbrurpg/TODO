RainbruRPG - A 3D multiplayer Role Playing Game project based on Ogre3D.

o [Carine] cross-compilation to win32
./bootstrap&&./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --prefix=/usr/cross/
- Fixing client executable size (310Mo) (see and update doc_cross_compil)

o [mouse] OgreGui : GUI over Ogre3D based on QuadRenderer
- gsServerList uses OgreGUI (with MulticolumnList)
- Error message label is not correctly placed in fullscreen mode

* Unittests
- Next unit test is common/loadbmp
- *** Unit tests failed in production mode (no --enable-debug) ***
   HTTP response 401 "Unauthorized"

* tool-adminsite-databackup
- a comand-line tool to backup adminsite XML files
- takes the version number as argument
- used by backup_prog script

* Adminsite
- See the tool-adminsite-databackup
- Made a info page on server status which is called from the homepage

o [mouse] xIdent
- XIdent AddAccount dialog and other buttons
- Modify the connection system

* FlooderTest
- FlooderTest test packet size (ftSize)
- FlooderTest test constant time flooding (2/200ms : packet lost?) (ftTime)

* Client 
- MessageBox can be closed with Enter/Return key
- gsUpdateDataFiles implementation
- client uses maincore/EnvironmentSetup
  Waiting to be to the same rendering level with EnvironmentSetup
  (Fog and Skydome)
- Client's debug console uses the readline library
- User can bookmark or blacklist servers
- In the first page (gsmainmenu), a `quick connect` system

* GameServer
   Interactive command-line server featuring debus and telnet API
   server/                 Contains the interactive command-line server
   server-gui/             The server's GUI related code
   server-gui/dbus-api/    The dbus related classes
   server-gui/telnet-api/  The telnet related classes
   server-gui/fox-gui/     Based on dbus-api(rainbrurpg-servergui-fox)
   server-gui/telnet-gui/  A telnet-based command-line remote control
- If server cannot connect to the database, a SEGFAULT occurs
- The HelpViewer is called twice (appears again when OK button clicked)
- Running 2 servers in the same PC is forbiden ( A lock file ?)
- The database must be connected even if the server is not started
- Update the client number in statusbar
- A dialog to export the program log (LogExportDialog)
- Entity/Relation model (Modèle Conceptuel de Données) in sql/

* Editor
- OgreView doesn't work anymore (Xlib error)
- PosorDialog initialization with the ObjectPos values (ObjectMesh name)
- OgreView cleanup (Give up unused functions and global variables)
- SelectionCycle test Entity name contains `Outline' (SEGFAULT)
- SelectionManager handle multiple selection
- MeshViewer Destructor (SEGFAULT if more than one is open)
- Environmentsetup uses skydome and fog
- Editor identification and cryptography of message done by GPG keys

* GuiSerializer
A system that serialize widgets position and configuration
- Two central classes GuiSerializer and SerializableWisget
- GuiSerializer is a singleton that handle XML files and widget vectors
   void setWidgetName(string)
   void setContextName
   void addValue(str key, value)
   bool getValue(key, &int)
   bool getValue(key, afloat)
   The bools are telling if the key was found
- SerialisableWidget is inherited by complex widget
   void serialize(GuiSerializer*)=0;
   void deserialize(GuiSerializer*)=0;
- The XML file for GuiSerializer
   GuiSerializer
      widgetName
         ContextName
           Key=value

* Miscellaneous
- Logger uses clog and cerr (from the IOstream Library)
- modifpersoattrb.php do not check fields content (NULL content allowed)
- Is CurlSubmitForm::computePostedData in use ?
- A file called adminmsg.xml with admin message to players (maintenance)
- Searching informations on Audiere
- The account is created only if the mail was correctly sent
- CurlAccountAdd::controlAfter tests if the account was correctly created
- RainbruRPG man pages should be renamed rainbrurpg (in lower case)
- pkg-config files (pc.in) give spurious value (-lRainbruRPG-1.0 ???)

  Title: Segfault fixed and crew update              2009-02-15 15:13:21
  Content: I finally fix a critical segmentation fault that occurred
   when a dialog was about to be drawn : it was a design error.

   I have to welcome Carine in the crew. She is now the official maintainer
   of the win32 port of the client. To contact her, please use the
   SourceForge email address (cchum at users.sourceforge.net)

   I will soon release the 0.0.6 version, probably in the next weeks, when
   OgreGui, my custom Graphic User Interface will be finished.
