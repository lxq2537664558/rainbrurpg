RainbruRPG - A 3D multiplayer Role Playing Game project based on Ogre3D.

o [Carine] cross-compilation to win32
./bootstrap&&./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --prefix=/usr/cross/ --enable-Wno-stddep-ogre
- Fixing maincore lib size (310Mo) (see and update doc_cross_compil)

o [rainbru] Fixing some OgreGui related graphical bugs
- Tooltip doesn't disappear if we aren't in the window anymore
- Moving MCL scrollbar when window's SB were moved is spurious 

o [rainbru] i18n (source are taken alphabetically)
   Please use GTS_* macros from rainbrudef.h for all translated
   strings using sprintf and parameters
- common/xmlpersolist.cpp was the last translated source

* OgreGui : GUI over Ogre3D based on QuadRenderer
- gsServerList uses OgreGUI (with MulticolumnList)
- Error message label is not correctly placed in fullscreen mode

* Unittests
- Next unit test is common/loadbmp
- Unit tests failed in production mode (no --enable-debug)
   HTTP response 401 "Unauthorized"

* tool-adminsite-databackup
- a comand-line tool to backup adminsite XML files
- takes the version number as argument
- used by backup_prog script

* Adminsite
- See the tool-adminsite-databackup
- Made a info page on server status which is called from the homepage

* xIdent
- XIdent AddAccount dialog and other buttons
- Modify the connection system

* FlooderTest
- FlooderTest test packet size (ftSize)
- FlooderTest test constant time flooding (2/200ms : packet lost?) (ftTime)

* Client 
- MessageBox can be closed with Enter/Return key
- gsUpdateDataFiles implementation
- client uses maincore/EnvironmentSetup
  Waiting to be to the same rendering level with EnvironmentSetup
  (Fog and Skydome)
- Client's debug console uses the readline library
- User can bookmark or blacklist servers
- In the first page (gsmainmenu), a `quick connect` system

* GameServer
   Interactive command-line server featuring debus and telnet API
   server/                 Contains the interactive command-line server
   server-gui/             The server's GUI related code
   server-gui/dbus-api/    The dbus related classes
   server-gui/telnet-api/  The telnet related classes
   server-gui/fox-gui/     Based on dbus-api(rainbrurpg-servergui-fox)
   server-gui/telnet-gui/  A telnet-based command-line remote control
- The HelpViewer is called twice (appears again when OK button clicked)
- Running 2 servers in the same PC is forbiden ( A lock file ?)
- The database must be connected even if the server is not started
- Update the client number in statusbar
- A dialog to export the program log (LogExportDialog)
- Entity/Relation model (Modèle Conceptuel de Données) in sql/

* Editor
- OgreView doesn't work anymore (Xlib error)
- PosorDialog initialization with the ObjectPos values (ObjectMesh name)
- OgreView cleanup (Give up unused functions and global variables)
- SelectionCycle test Entity name contains `Outline' (SEGFAULT)
- SelectionManager handle multiple selection
- MeshViewer Destructor (SEGFAULT if more than one is open)
- Environmentsetup uses skydome and fog
- Editor identification and cryptography of message done by GPG keys

* GuiSerializer
A system that serialize widgets position and configuration
- Two central classes GuiSerializer and SerializableWisget
- GuiSerializer is a singleton that handle XML files and widget vectors
   void setWidgetName(string)
   void setContextName
   void addValue(str key, value)
   bool getValue(key, &int)
   bool getValue(key, afloat)
   The bools are telling if the key was found
- SerialisableWidget is inherited by complex widget
   void serialize(GuiSerializer*)=0;
   void deserialize(GuiSerializer*)=0;
- The XML file for GuiSerializer
   GuiSerializer
      widgetName
         ContextName
           Key=value

* Transmsg
   This tool should extract text from the server and editor to the
   users, making a POT file (quest, server's messages, objects
   name...). This pot file, translated and compiled by the server
   administrator will be downloaded by the users for their own
   language. The gettext textdomain should be the server's unique name
   to avoid message identifier's conflicts.
- Can gettext have multiple textdomain (RainbruRPG and server's unique name)?

* Using glib's thread instead of boost::thread
   Must see the config.h defines related to libintl
- To remove the boost::thread dependency, glib is needed by gnet

* Miscellaneous
- Logger uses clog and cerr (from the IOstream Library)
- modifpersoattrb.php do not check fields content (NULL content allowed)
- Is CurlSubmitForm::computePostedData in use ?
- A file called adminmsg.xml with admin message to players (maintenance)
- Searching informations on Audiere
- The account should be created only if the mail was correctly sent
- CurlAccountAdd::controlAfter tests if the account was correctly created
- RainbruRPG man pages should be renamed rainbrurpg (in lower case)
- pkg-config files (pc.in) give spurious value (-lRainbruRPG-1.0 ???)
- Implementation of the option*attribute::update() functions
