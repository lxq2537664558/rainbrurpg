RainbruRPG - A 3D multiplayer Role Playing Game project based on Ogre3D.

-> Libraries versionning in doc/libVersionning.html and configure.in

o [Carine] cross-compilation to win32
./bootstrap&&./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --prefix=/usr/cross/
- Fixing client executable size (310Mo) (see and update doc_cross_compil)

o [mouse] OgreGui : GUI over Ogre3D based on QuadRenderer
- gsServerList uses OgreGUI (with MulticolumnList)
- Error message label is not correctly placed in fullscreen mode
- MessageBox makes segfault (see bug #26)

* Unittests
- Next unit test is common/loadbmp
- *** Unit tests failed in production mode (no --enable-debug) ***
   HTTP response 401 "Unauthorized"

* tool-adminsite-databackup
- a comand-line tool to backup adminsite XML files
- takes the version number as argument
- used by backup_prog script

* Adminsite
- See the tool-adminsite-databackup
- Remove bonusfile and others
- Remove associated common/ classes
- Made a info page which is called from the homepage

o [mouse] xIdent
- XIdent AddAccount dialog and other buttons
- Modify the connection system

* FlooderTest
- FlooderTest test packet size (ftSize)
- FlooderTest test constant time flooding (2/200ms : packet lost?) (ftTime)

* Client 
- MessageBox can be closed with Enter/Return key
- gsUpdateDataFiles implementation
- client uses maincore/EnvironmentSetup
  Waiting to be to the same rendering level with EnvironmentSetup
  (Fog and Skydome)
- Client's debug console uses the readline library
- User can bookmark or blacklist servers
- In the first page (gsmainmenu), a `quick connect` system

* GameServer
   Interactive command-line server featuring debus and telnet API
   server/                 Contains the interactive command-line server
   server-gui/             The server's GUI related code
   server-gui/dbus-api/    The dbus related classes
   server-gui/telnet-api/  The telnet related classes
   server-gui/fox-gui/     Based on dbus-api(rainbrurpg-servergui-fox)
   server-gui/telnet-gui/  A telnet-based command-line remote control
- If server cannot connect to the database, a SEGFAULT occurs
- The HelpViewer is called twice (appears again when OK button clicked)
- Running 2 servers in the same PC is forbiden ( A lock file ?)
- The database must be connected even if the server is not started
- Update the client number in statusbar
- A dialog to export the program log (LogExportDialog)
- Entity/Relation model (Modèle Conceptuel de Données) in sql/

* Editor
- OgreView doesn't work anymore (Xlib error)
- PosorDialog initialization with the ObjectPos values (ObjectMesh name)
- OgreView cleanup (Give up unused functions and global variables)
- SelectionCycle test Entity name contains `Outline' (SEGFAULT)
- SelectionManager handle multiple selection
- MeshViewer Destructor (SEGFAULT if more than one is open)
- Environmentsetup uses skydome and fog
- Editor identification and cryptography of message done by GPG keys

* GuiSerializer
A system that serialize widgets position and configuration
- Two central classes GuiSerializer and SerializableWisget
- GuiSerializer is a singleton that handle XML files and widget vectors
   void setWidgetName(string)
   void setContextName
   void addValue(str key, value)
   bool getValue(key, &int)
   bool getValue(key, afloat)
   The bools are telling if the key was found
- SerialisableWidget is inherited by complex widget
   void serialize(GuiSerializer*)=0;
   void deserialize(GuiSerializer*)=0;
- The XML file for GuiSerializer
   GuiSerializer
      widgetName
         ContextName
           Key=value

* Miscellaneous
- Logger uses clog and cerr (from the IOstream Library)
- modifpersoattrb.php do not check fields content (NULL content allowed)
- Is CurlSubmitForm::computePostedData in use ?
- A file called adminmsg.xml with admin message to players (maintenance)
- Searching informations on Audiere
- The account is created only if the mail was correctly sent
- CurlAccountAdd::controlAfter tests if the account was correctly created
- RainbruRPG man pages should be renamed rainbrurpg (in lower case)
- pkg-config files (pc.in) give spurious value (-lRainbruRPG-1.0 ???)
