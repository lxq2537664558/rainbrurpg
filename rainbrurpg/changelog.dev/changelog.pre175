- Glyph base implementation
- TitleBar drawn by QuadRenderer
- active ResizeGrip drawn 
- ResizeGrip drawn by QuadRenderer
- Window drawn by QuadRenderer
- OgreGuiRenderQueueListener registered to GameEngine's SceneManager
- QuadRenderer now here

- Scrollbar::getValueFromCursor(void) implementation
- Scrollbar max ans steps implementation
- Scrollbar widget implementation
- Adding Widget mouse support to Window's event handling loop
- Widget::injectMouse implementation
- Window destructor
  o As ResizeGrip does not need a caption, it does not use the 
    Button::mCP. The pointer is NULL and the Button::~Button
    destructor, trying to call mCP->getParent() made a segmentation 
    fault.                         FIXED
- Button destructor is virtual and ResizeGrip destructor is
   implemented to avoid a segfault in accessing mCP->getParent()
- Testing number of registered window in GUI::addWindow()
- TextInput::setMasked(true) implementation

* v 0.0.5-161
- gsCreateAccount buttons implementation
- gsCreateAccount uses betaGUI

- soBetaGui::createBorderWindow implementation
- Skin::createBorderWindow declaration
- Window constructor
  A bool saying if it is a framed window or not
- gsConnection::onConnectClicked uses OgreGUI
  Name and password values are now taken from the OgreGUI widgets

* v 0.0.5-160
- Doxygen documentation
  o Fix undocumented members (mainly soNavigation)
  o Error when generating Doxygen documentation in PNG image format
  Switching to jpg images fix it
- New SkinId : OSI_PARENT for inherited skin identifier
  All widgets now inherits their SkinId from their parent
  but this can be changed from a constructor parameter
- Mouse button comes again :(
   FIXED in GameEngine::mousePressed()
- gsMainMenu buttons bug
  o buttons don't get mouse click event
  gsMenuBase::mousePressed must call BGGUI::injectMouse
- Moving Window bug :
  o When we click the 'Network Game" button of gsMainMenu
  we go to the gsConnection state and the Connection window
  is moving without left mouse button is clicked.
  o FIXED : please see gsMenuBase::transition() implementation for
  further details.
  o When we go back from gsConnection to gsMainMenu, the bug happens again
  -> Trying to use isMouseBouttonPressed as static member
  -> isMouseBouttonPressed now in BetaGUI::GUI
- Transparency transition bug
  o When going from gsConnection to gsMainMenu, gsConnection is fade
  in and then reappears
  o The transparency is correctly set in gsMainMenu
  o GUI::setGuiTransparency receive >0.7f values
  o GuiManager::increaseGuiTransparency send bad values (>0.7f)
  o guimanager.cpp:338 A hack that fixes this bug
- gsConnection uses betaGUI
- gsMenuBase menu overlays now create on their own overlay
  They was added to the BetaGUI overlay, but for a ZOrder issue 
  (gsConnection's Back button was hidden by numDebugWindow) I create
  their own one.
- Window::alwaysTransparent() implementation
- soNavigation implementation
- Images nav.button and nav.button.active created
- Some memory leaks fixed (with valgring)
- are -lIL -lILU -lILUT mandatory in aclocal ? NO
  To fix the JPG texture bug, use -ljpeg
- JPG texture bug fixed
  Adding libjpeg to the client seems to fix it. Trying to remove
  -lIL -lILU -lILUT.
- Try to use PKG_CHECK_MODULES in configure
  Do not assume anymore libraries are in /usr/local/lib
- soBetaGUI : fnTextInput and fsTextInput replaced by fnCaption and
  fsCaption to be used by TextInput::caption and Label
- A Label widget for static text caption
  It does not provide a frame or background. Only text.
- gsMainMenu uses betaGUI
- editor/Makefile.am updated to be linked with ogreGUI

* v 0.0.5-159
- Window::minimalSize implementation. To prevent extreme high
  value of unsigned int width and height.
- Window moving using devX and devY to prevent the move of the window
  only from the middle of its width
- Fix the moving Window bug  
- Find the resize bug and use a flag
  The mouse event are sent to the GUI object so, the flag must be in
  GUI. We get a resizedWindow field in GUI which is NULL if no window
  is moving. Otherwise, it is a pointer to the mocing window.
- OgreGUI now depends on MainCore (Ogre)
- Doxygen documentation update due to skin update
  Widget, SkinOverlay, doc.h due to a Skin reference
  refman.pdf = 1251 pages
- Widget are now only based on Ogre::Overlay
  For performance issues due to Ogre::String identifier
   I must give up skin.h and keep only skinOverlay based skin
  The skinOverlay function that get a String identifier will now
   use a OgreOverlay parameter
  Widget will manage their OverlayContainer pointers
  Worst FPS with String ID are 94-99
- SkinOverlay::setCaptionTransparency get a OverlayContainer parameter
  In the Button subclasses we *must* reimplement setTransparency
  because of ResizeGrip that do not have a caption.
- SkinOverlay::setTransparency get a OverlayContainer parameter
- The Skin class doesn't exist anymore
  To switch to overlay-based skins, the Skin class is gave up.
- Homepage new about the skin implementation
  Title : Switching to overlay-based skins
  Content : Because of a lack of performance, I must change the
   OgreGUI skin design. Skins wer implemented with the idea we could 
   use anoter graphical ojects than Ogre overlays and it was a bad idea.
   [br]
   [br]I will modify this design to base the skins implementation only 
   on Ogre overlays. This should increase performance by using overlay 
   pointers instead os String identifier.
   [br]
   [br]This will delay the next public release but this design error 
   should be fastly fixed.
