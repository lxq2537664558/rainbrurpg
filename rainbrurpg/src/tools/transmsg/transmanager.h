/** \file tools/transmsg/transmanager.h
  * Declares a translation manager
  *
  * Modifications :
  * - 22 sep 2008 : Single file documentation
  * - 04 jan 2008 : GNU header added
  *
  * \todo Should contain code. This file does not contains any code and should
  *       be the manager for translation. Using the 
  *       \ref RainbruRPG::Trans::TransFile "TransFile" class, it could
  *       search translatable string in a whole directory (using \c dirent.h
  *       for directory informations).
