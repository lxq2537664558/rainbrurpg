rainbruWebsite - GPLv2 - Create a skin for our Wordpress/Foswiki
   integration.

* Wordpress : static test
- 'search button' hasn't this style normally

* Style
- css names must be prefixed
   skin<name>_*
- must add explicit sizes for the title
   because now, we take the over css style and in the wordpress page,
   it gives a very big 'RainbruRPG' h1 header
