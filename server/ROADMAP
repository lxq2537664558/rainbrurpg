**** Make a rainbrurpg-server-ruby-console binary
     The same as the previous item (guile one)
**** Make a rainbrurpg-server-guile-console binary
     in src/tools, with needed api modules preloaded to be
     able to test for guile an interactive way.

- [X] Add boost-asio as dependencies both in configure.in and DEPENDENCIES
- [X] Need boost_filestem to avoid undefined reference to 
     `boost::system::get_generic_category() error
- [X] Create a TCP server listening to a default port
- [-] server-ctl IP:port using default port if missing
  We should find a way to get multi GUI ctl tool, for example Qt, cwidget.
  Maybe as a subdir with configure options. 
  - [X] libreadline to get history of command
    - [X] Must enable auto-completion of commands
      start, stop, list, help, quit
  - [X] Must modernize automake files
  - [X] Fix boost::asio::ip::tcp::acceptor has no 'io_service'
  - [ ] basic command should run functions
    A ServerCommand superclass with a execute(str parmas) virtual function
    - [ ] readline usage code must be ported to C++
    - [ ] Then a CommandList, fed at startup that can return the cmd list
      Executing command works but these command are neither in help nor
      in autocompletion
  - [ ] boost-program_options to read argument
  - [ ] regex to get port and to test for IP
  - [ ] manpage and texinfo manual for the available commands
- [ ] Add GNU headers to all files
- [ ] See if gearman could be interresting (see http://gearman.org)
**** DONE Correct project setup
