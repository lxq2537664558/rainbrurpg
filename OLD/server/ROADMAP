**** A foswiki-powered DataForm-based metaserver web
- [ ] We may have to modify robots.txt to make this web indexable
**** Server's git-based filesystem
- [ ] libmagic auto distribute uploaded files in the data tree
   data/
     images/
     music/
     model/
   logic/
     ruby/
   sql/             export ?
   help
     ruby/          generated by client's rdoc  before commit work?
- [ ] Find how to clone postgres datas ?
**** Create a console binary tool
- Make a rainbrurpg-server-ruby-console binary
  The same as the previous item (guile one)
- Make a rainbrurpg-server-guile-console binary
  in src/tools, with needed api modules preloaded to be
  able to test for guile an interactive way.
- *Or use Boost.python and a a embedded python interpreter*
**** TODO Create a basic TCP server with a server-ctl tool

- [X] Add boost-asio as dependencies both in configure.in and DEPENDENCIES
- [X] Need boost_filestem to avoid undefined reference to 
     `boost::system::get_generic_category() error
- [X] Create a TCP server listening to a default port
- [X] server-ctl IP:port using default port if missing
  We should find a way to get multi GUI ctl tool, for example Qt, cwidget.
  Maybe as a subdir with configure options. 
  - [X] libreadline to get history of command
    - [X] Must enable auto-completion of commands
      start, stop, list, help, quit
  - [X] Must modernize automake files
  - [X] Fix boost::asio::ip::tcp::acceptor has no 'io_service'
- [X] Add GNU headers to all files
- [X] CommandLine (hpp/cpp)
  - [X] #bool getNext() return true if we must quit
  - [X] 3 pure C functions remain in CommandLine.cpp
    - [X] First the completion function (my_completion)
      it's a fonction pointer, uses an instance and a wrapper
    - [X] Then, other wrappers
    - [X] Must handle the cmd char array correctly and add added commands
      to it
- [X] Completion add an extra space to command so quit when called from
  completion isn't understand properly, we must chomp command before testing it
- [ ] May handle short command a guile-ish way as ,q ,h and others
- [ ] Remove dupstr
- [ ] Continue server-ctl implementation
  - [ ] basic command should run functions
    A ServerCommand superclass with a execute(str parmas) virtual function
    - [ ] readline usage code must be ported to C++
    - [ ] Then a CommandList, fed at startup that can return the cmd list
      Executing command works but these command are neither in help nor
      in autocompletion
  - [ ] boost-program_options to read argument
  - [ ] regex to get port and to test for IP
  - [ ] manpage and texinfo manual for the available commands
- [ ] See if gearman could be interresting (see http://gearman.org)
- [ ] Could start to use IPC for server/ctl communication
  - Boost.Interprocess could be fine
  - Or use a real network connection with an admin user to be able to admin
    distant server. 
  - Packets are send in BSon format) and proto defined in
    src/tools/proto to be able to create a Qt5 admin tool and so on.
  - Maybe authenticate the admin user using a SSH key
    see http://api.libssh.org/master/libssh_tutor_guided_tour.html
  - Regular client could choose to use SSH as well.
**** DONE Correct project setup

- [X] Feed this file with TODO content
- [X] create a DEPENDENCIES file
- [X] Create a basic src/main.cpp
- [X] Uses autoscan to create a basic autoconf package
- [X] Switch to GPLv3
- [X] Correctly set svn:ignore property
- [X] pkg-config should search for logger
- [X] Correct use of rainbrurpg-logger
      - [X] Must change the logfile name
      - [X] Should make the logheader contain server-related information
