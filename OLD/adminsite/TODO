adminsite - GPLv2 - The meta server of RainbruRPG. Written in PHP.

o [mouse] Should use another XML library
- Modules/XmlModuleBase.php
   Some functions should be removed:
   getChildNodeList() can be use instead of getChildNode()
- Modules/Xml_Domxml.php: domxml php4
- Modules/Xml_Domphp5.php: domxml php5
- Def.php with version

* Should made dtd files for validation

* May use UML rewritting
- http//.../rpg/admin/perso/list -> PersoList.php
   This way, we could write only one php file by type. Perso.php
   could handle different actions. The same result could be reached
   with params: http//.../rpg/admin/index.php?page=perso&action=list.
   
* Miscellaneous
- xmlpersoattrb.php create category if it does not exist
- Test global player
        - The title drawing is bugged
        - If we have more than one note, when we modify the first, the
          note field content of the first is spurious

* Improve documentation
- Make a mainpage. The actual one is the unit test one.

* Remove bonusfile and others
