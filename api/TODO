rainbrurpg-api - GPLV3 - Tools to generate RPG api documentation.

* Must handle
   A perl script generates Foswiki webs we can easily rsync with
   webhost :
   - We only parse C++ comments that start with '*>'
   - We have to handle some org-mode styled metatags '*> UPPER+=... '
      and maybe the script scope (complete directory or file)
   - How to discover C++ name in ruby and guile (for x-reference) ?
   - I don't know yet how to use subwebs :
   Api        or           Api               or      Doc
   | C++                   | Logger                  | Api
   | Ruby                  | Network                 | Scripting
   | Guile                 | (others)
   Or simply an Api web with use of DataForms (we can easily generate
   %META:FORM% and %META:FIELD% Values, using a special User
   (DocGeneraor)
   Then some search results : browse by language, browse by library.
   We have to handle cross-reference of type by language and to the Concept web.
- libraries API (logger, servces..) with doxygen
   URLs like api/logger/, api/services/...
   Using doxygen XML output, we can easily generate Foswiki pages.
- Then Documentation for plugins creation
   Maybe in texinfo in each library/api/ *TO BE REMOVED*
   Where texinfo can be generated from doxygen wih special macro
     API_RUBY || API_GUILE || API_BOTH
   URL like scripting/guile/
                     /ruby/
